# Roastie!

Not ready for release :) 

## Getting Started

Trying to learn some C# by implementing a point and click kerberoasting client. 
It's not done yet. When it is, i will remove this warning. 

Urgh, just learned that Rubeus already had a module for this. :(
My goodness harmj0y is a proper talented bugger. 
Nevermind, still gonna finish this thing out.
